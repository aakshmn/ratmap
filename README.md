## Key Features
- **Interactive Plate Mapping:**  
  - Click to toggle selection of individual wells
  - Click and drag to select multiple wells in rectangular regions
  - Toggle entire rows, columns, or complete plates with a single click
- **Metadata Management:**  
  - Rename metadata layers to suit your experiment using the dropdown menu and Rename button
  - **Value Assignment:**  
    - **Basic Assignment:** Enter a single value to assign to one or multiple selected wells. When a single well is selected, the app auto-advances (by default in column-major order) to the next well.  
    - **Bulk Assignment with Comma or Space-Separated Values:**  
      - Enter a comma or space-separated list of values to assign to multiple selected cells at once.  
      - **Note:** The number of values must exactly match the number of selected wells.  
      - **Assignment Order:**  
        - **Default (Column-Major):** Values are assigned from top to bottom, left to right.  
        - **Row-Major Option:** Hold the **Shift** key when clicking **Assign** (or pressing Enter) to assign values in row-major order.
    - **Quoted Assignment:**
      - Values enclosed in double quotes will be treated as a single entry, even if they contain commas or spaces.
- **Metadata Visualization:**
  - Use the **Visualize** button to toggle a color-coded view of your metadata
  - Color gradients are automatically assigned to unique values in the selected metadata layer
  - Toggle between normal selection mode and visualization mode with the same button
  - Click any well to exit visualization mode and return to selection mode
- **Quadrant Mapping:**  
  - Map data from 96-well plates to specific quadrants on 384-well plates using the Source and Destination dropdowns
- **CSV Export:**  
  - Exports metadata in an analysis-ready format following long-form (tidy) conventions
  - **For 96-well Plates:**  
      - Includes a unique `sample_id_96w` (a combination of the experiment ID, plate ID, and well ID), Plate and Well IDs, and all assigned metadata columns.  
  - **For 384-well Plates:**  
      - Includes a unique `sample_id_384w`, Plate and Well IDs, quadrant information, and—if quadrant mapping was used—additional mapping columns such as `sample_id_96w`, `Src_Plate_96w`, and `Src_Well_96w`, along with all metadata columns.  
  - **Experiment ID:** You can provide an optional Experiment ID during export or skip it by leaving it blank.
- **Save and Load:**
  - Save your current plate configuration and metadata for later use
  - Load previously saved data to continue your work
  - **Example Data:** Try loading this [example data file](https://github.com/aakshmn/ratmap/blob/main/ratmap_data_20250314.json) to see a pre-configured plate setup
  - **Save Function Details:**
    - The Save function creates a JSON file containing your current plate configuration and metadata
    - **JSON File Structure:**
      - Includes `version` (currently "0.3"), `timestamp` (ISO format), `layerNames`, `plate96wData`, and `plate384wData` properties
      - Timestamp captures the exact moment of saving for reference
      - Default filename is "ratmap_data.json"
      - **Filename Flexibility:** The default filename can be changed by the user after downloading without affecting functionality; the system validates file content, not the filename, when loading
    - **Activation Methods:**
      - Click the Save button in the top section
      - Use keyboard shortcut Ctrl/⌘ + S
    - **Usage Tips:**
      - Save files can be shared with colleagues for collaborative work
      - Files are compatible across browsers that support modern JavaScript
      - Regular saving is recommended to prevent data loss during long mapping sessions
  - **Load Function Details:**
    - The Load function expects a JSON file created by the Save function in RatMap
    - **Expected JSON Format:**
      - The file must include `version`, `timestamp`, `layerNames`, `plate96wData`, and `plate384wData` properties
      - `layerNames` must be an array of 9 strings representing metadata layer names
      - `plate96wData` and `plate384wData` contain structured objects with well metadata
    - **Validation Process:**
      - The Load function validates all file properties and data structures
      - It checks metadata values and mapping data integrity
      - If validation fails, an error message will be displayed
    - **Loading Behavior:**
      - When data is successfully loaded, all plates are automatically toggled on, ensuring visibility of all loaded metadata
      - This prevents users from missing data in hidden plates
      - After loading, we recommend quickly switching through all metadata layers (using Ctrl/⌘ + [1-9] shortcuts) to review all loaded data
      - A backup of your current data is saved before loading and will be restored if any errors occur
- **Undo Functionality:**  
  - One-level undo to revert accidental changes using the Undo button
- **Keyboard Shortcuts Help:**
  - Press Ctrl/⌘ + / to view a comprehensive list of available keyboard shortcuts

## Troubleshooting & Pro Tips

### Common Issues
- **No Wells Selected:**  
  - Ensure you select at least one well before assigning a metadata value.
- **List Assignment Error:**  
  - The number of values in your comma/space-separated list must match the number of selected wells.
  - Values must be from a single plate for list assignments.
- **Memory Warning:**  
  - If you receive a memory alert, consider clearing unnecessary data or saving and refreshing the page.
- **Visualization Not Showing:**
  - Make sure the current metadata layer contains values for the wells you want to visualize.
- **Table Dimensions Inconsistent:**
  - The app automatically equalizes table dimensions when multiple plates are visible, but you may need to refresh or toggle plates to fix alignment issues.

### Pro Tips
- **Efficient Selection:**  
  - Use click-and-drag for quick rectangular selections instead of clicking each well individually.
  - Use the keyboard shortcuts to select entire plates (Ctrl/⌘ + Alt/Option + Shift + [number]).
  - Click on row or column headers to toggle entire rows or columns quickly.
- **Layer Management:**  
  - Keep your metadata layers succinct. Rename them to reflect their purpose (e.g., "Temperature", "Compound", "Concentration").
  - When working with multiple metadata types, switch between layers frequently to build a complete dataset.
- **Value Assignment Shortcuts:**
  - Use **Enter** to assign and advance to the next well in column-major order.
  - Use **Shift+Enter** to assign and advance in row-major order.
  - Use **Shift+Alt/Option+Enter** to quickly rename the current layer.
- **Quoted Values:**
  - Enclose values in double quotes (") to include commas or spaces within a single value.
  - Example: `"PBS, 1X"` will be treated as a single value.
- **Visualization Usage:**
  - The automatic color-coding helps quickly identify patterns or errors in your plate layout
  - Use keyboard shortcuts to rapidly switch between metadata layers for comparing different parameters
  - Color gradients make it easy to spot missing values or outliers in your data
  - The immediate visual feedback helps verify correct metadata assignment
- **Save Your Work:**
  - Use the Save button frequently to prevent data loss, especially during long mapping sessions.
  - Downloaded save files can be shared with colleagues for collaborative work.
- **Exporting Data:**  
  - Verify the visible plates' checkboxes before exporting CSV files to ensure all desired data is included.
  - The Experiment ID is optional during export - provide one for better organization or leave it blank to skip.
  - Export early and often to backup your work, especially for complex mappings.
- **Undo Usage:**  
  - Use the Undo button immediately after an error—it's your safety net in the maze of data.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
  - Learn the keyboard shortcuts for frequent actions to speed up your workflow.
  - The shortcuts help popup (Ctrl/⌘ + /) is your friend.
