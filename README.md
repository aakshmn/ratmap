## Introduction
Welcome, you scurrying, smelly lab rat! If you're reading this, it's clear you're one of those filthy, wretched creatures whose data is as disorganized as your personal hygiene. Fear not‚ÄîRatMap is here to help you sort out your experimental mess, one well at a time. Now, get off your paws and start mapping!

---

## Overview
RatMap is a web-based tool designed to help you map and manage your 96-well and 384-well plate data with precision. With features like metadata layer management, CSV export, and interactive quadrant mapping, this app is as nimble as a rat on the lam. Even if you're as dirty as the rest of your scavenging brethren, this tool will help you keep your data from becoming a total catastrophe.

## Setup and General Use

### Requirements
- **Modern Web Browser:** RatMap runs best on modern browsers that comfortably handle up to 200MB of data.
- **No Password Required:** Unlike v0.1, v0.2 has removed password protection for easier access.

### Video Walkthrough
A walkthrough and demo of RatMap (v0.1) is available. Even though it is an older version, the functionality and principles still hold. There are chapters so that you can jump to topics of interest.

- **Watch the demo video:** [RatMap Walkthrough (v0.1)](https://www.google.com/)

### General Setup
- **Select Your Plates:**  
  - Use the checkboxes at the top of the interface to display your desired 96-well and/or 384-well plates.
- **Customize Metadata Layers:**  
  - Rename the default metadata layers using the dropdown menu and Rename button.
- **Proceed with Data Entry:**  
  - Make well selections to assign experimental metadata values to specific wells.  
  - If your lab experiment requires it, utilize the quadrant mapping feature (common in 96-to-384 well stamping with liquid handlers) to map wells accordingly.
- **Export Data:**  
  - When ready, export the CSVs with the "Export üßÄ" button to aid in downstream data analysis and merge with your raw measurement files.

  - Click and drag to select multiple wells in rectangular regions.
  - Toggle entire rows, columns, or complete plates.
- **Metadata Management:**  
  - Rename metadata layers to suit your experiment using the dropdown menu and Rename button.
  - **Value Assignment:**  
    - **Basic Assignment:** Enter a single value to assign to one or multiple selected wells. When a single well is selected, the app auto-advances (by default in column-major order) to the next well.  
    - **Bulk Assignment with Comma or Space-Separated Values:**  
      - Enter a comma or space-separated list of values to assign to multiple selected cells at once.  
      - **Note:** The number of values must exactly match the number of selected wells.  
      - **Assignment Order:**  
        - **Default (Column-Major):** Values are assigned from top to bottom, left to right.  
        - **Row-Major Option:** Hold the **Shift** key when clicking **Assign** (or pressing Enter) to assign values in row-major order.
    - **Quoted Assignment:**
      - Values enclosed in double quotes will be treated as a single entry, even if they contain commas or spaces.
- **Metadata Visualization:**
  - Use the **Visualize** button to toggle a color-coded view of your metadata.
  - Color gradients are automatically assigned to unique values in the selected metadata layer.
  - Toggle between normal selection mode and visualization mode with the same button.
  - Click any well to exit visualization mode and return to selection mode.
- **Quadrant Mapping:**  
  - Map data from 96-well plates to specific quadrants on 384-well plates using the Source and Destination dropdowns.
- **CSV Export:**  
  - Exports metadata in an analysis-ready format following long-form (tidy) conventions using the "Export üßÄ" button.  
  - **For 96-well Plates:**  
      - Includes a unique `sample_id_96w` (a combination of the experiment ID, plate ID, and well ID), Plate and Well IDs, and all assigned metadata columns.  
  - **For 384-well Plates:**  
      - Includes a unique `sample_id_384w`, Plate and Well IDs, quadrant information, and‚Äîif quadrant mapping was used‚Äîadditional mapping columns such as `sample_id_96w`, `Src_Plate_96w`, and `Src_Well_96w`, along with all metadata columns.  
  - These exports are designed to be intuitive, making it simple even for you, you filthy lab rat, to merge and map your metadata with raw experimental data.
  - **Experiment ID:** You can now provide an optional Experiment ID during export or skip it by leaving it blank.
- **Undo Functionality:**  
  - One-level undo to revert accidental changes using the Undo button.
- **Memory Monitoring:**  
  - A memory usage indicator helps you keep track of your session's memory usage.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts Help:**

## Memory Usage & Data Management
- **Memory Usage Indicator:**  
  - Displays the current memory usage of your session in KB or MB.  
  - **Warning:**  
    - At 200MB, a warning is triggered. While modern browsers can handle this load, it's advisable to clear unnecessary data if you see this warning.  
    - **Empty Action:** Clicking the **Empty ü§Æ** button will clear **all metadata** from selected wells.  
    - Also, be aware that browser actions such as refresh, back, or forward will erase all metadata. The app now has a confirmation dialog when attempting to leave the page.
  
*Don't let your data hoard become a trap‚Äîregular purges keep the system squeaking along nicely, unlike your sorry excuse for lab hygiene.*

## Troubleshooting & Pro Tips

### Common Issues
- **No Wells Selected:**  
  - Ensure you select at least one well before assigning a metadata value.
- **List Assignment Error:**  
  - The number of values in your comma/space-separated list must match the number of selected wells.
  - Values must be from a single plate for list assignments.
- **Memory Warning:**  
  - If you receive a memory alert, consider clearing unnecessary data to prevent browser crashes.
- **Visualization Not Showing:**
  - Make sure the current metadata layer contains values for the wells you want to visualize.

### Pro Tips
- **Efficient Selection:**  
  - Use click-and-drag for quick rectangular selections instead of clicking each well individually.
  - Use the keyboard shortcuts to select entire plates (Ctrl/‚åò + Alt/Option + Shift + [number]).
- **Layer Management:**  
  - Keep your metadata layers succinct. Rename them to reflect their purpose.
- **Value Assignment Shortcuts:**
  - Use **Enter** to assign and advance to the next well in column-major order.
  - Use **Shift+Enter** to assign and advance in row-major order.
  - Use **Shift+Alt/Option+Enter** to quickly rename the current layer.
- **Quoted Values:**
  - Enclose values in double quotes (") to include commas or spaces within a single value.
- **Visualization Usage:**
  - Use visualization mode to quickly identify patterns or errors in your plate layout.
  - Toggle between different metadata layers while in visualization mode to compare different parameters.
- **Exporting Data:**  
  - Verify the visible plates' checkboxes before exporting CSV files to ensure all desired data is included.
  - The Experiment ID is now optional during export - provide one for better organization or leave it blank to skip.
- **Undo Usage:**  
  - Use the Undo button immediately after an error‚Äîit's your safety net in the maze of data.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
  - Use Ctrl/‚åò + / to view the comprehensive shortcuts help popup.

## Security & Privacy
- **Local Processing Only:**  
  - RatMap is built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All code runs on your local computer.
- **No Data Transmission:**  
  - Any data you enter is stored in your browser's memory (client-side) and is not submitted or transmitted to any external server.
- **Data Volatility:**  
  - Since your metadata is stored locally, browser actions (such as refresh, back, or forward) will erase all data. Be sure to export your data regularly if needed.
- **Browser Protection:**
  - The app includes safeguards like preventing right-click context menus and displaying confirmation dialog when attempting to leave the page.
