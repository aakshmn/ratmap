## Introduction
Welcome, you scurrying, smelly lab rat! If you‚Äôre reading this, it's clear you're one of those filthy, wretched creatures whose data is as disorganized as your personal hygiene. Fear not‚ÄîRatMap is here to help you sort out your experimental mess, one well at a time. Now, get off your paws and start mapping!

---

## Overview
RatMap is a web-based tool designed to help you map and manage your 96-well and 384-well plate data with precision. With features like metadata layer management, CSV export, and interactive quadrant mapping, this app is as nimble as a rat on the lam. Even if you‚Äôre as dirty as the rest of your scavenging brethren, this tool will help you keep your data from becoming a total catastrophe.

## Setup and General Use

### Requirements
- **Modern Web Browser:** RatMap runs best on modern browsers that comfortably handle up to 200MB of data.
- **Password Protection:** When the app loads, you'll be prompted for a password. Enter it, you rancid rodent.

### General Setup
- **Select Your Plates:**  
  - Use the checkboxes to display your desired 96-well and/or 384-well plates.
- **Customize Metadata Layers:**  
  - Optionally rename the default metadata layers to custom names via the Layer Naming control.
- **Proceed with Data Entry:**  
  - Make well selections to assign experimental metadata values to specific wells.  
  - If your lab experiment requires it, utilize the quadrant mapping feature (common in 96-to-384 well stamping with liquid handlers) to map wells accordingly.
- **Export Data:**  
  - When ready, export the CSVs to aid in downstream data analysis and merge with your raw measurement files.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Plate Mapping:**  
  - Click or Shift+Click to select wells.  
  - Toggle entire rows, columns, or complete plates.
- **Metadata Management:**  
  - Rename metadata layers to suit your experiment.
  - **Value Assignment:**  
    - **Basic Assignment:** Enter a single value to assign to one or multiple selected wells. When a single well is selected, the app auto-advances (by default in column-major order) to the next well.  
    - **Bulk Assignment with Comma-Separated Values:**  
      - Enter a comma-separated list of values to assign to multiple selected cells at once.  
      - **Note:** The number of comma-separated values must exactly match the number of selected wells.  
      - **Assignment Order:**  
        - **Default (Column-Major):** Values are assigned from top to bottom, left to right.  
        - **Row-Major Option:** Hold the **Shift** key when clicking **Assign** (or pressing Enter) to assign values in row-major order.
- **Quadrant Mapping:**  
  - Map data from 96-well plates to specific quadrants on 384-well plates.
- **CSV Export:**  
  - Exports metadata in an analysis-ready format following long-form (tidy) conventions.  
  - **For 96-well Plates:**  
      - Includes a unique `sample_id_96w` (a combination of the plate ID and well ID), Plate and Well IDs, and all assigned metadata columns.  
  - **For 384-well Plates:**  
      - Includes a unique `sample_id_384w`, Plate and Well IDs, and‚Äîif quadrant mapping was used‚Äîadditional mapping columns such as `sample_id_96w`, `Src_Plate_96w`, and `Src_Well_96w`, along with all metadata columns.  
  - These exports are designed to be intuitive, making it simple even for you, you filthy lab rat, to merge and map your metadata with raw experimental data.
- **Undo Functionality:**  
  - One-level undo to revert accidental changes.
- **Memory Monitoring:**  
  - A ‚ÄúRat Cache‚Äù gauge helps you keep track of your session‚Äôs memory usage.

## Using RatMap

### Global Controls Panel
- **Layer Naming:**  
  - Select a metadata layer from the dropdown, input a new name, and click **Rename**.
- **Value Assignment:**  
  - **Basic Assignment:**  
    - Choose a metadata layer, enter the desired value, and click **Assign**.  
    - *Auto-Advance:* When a single well is selected, the selection automatically advances to the next well in column-major order.  
    - To have the selection advance in row-major order for single-cell entries, hold the **Shift** key during assignment.
  - **Bulk Assignment with Comma-Separated Values:**  
    - Enter a comma-separated list of values to assign to multiple selected wells.  
    - Ensure the number of values exactly matches the number of selected cells.  
    - Use the **Shift** key to switch the assignment order from the default column-major to row-major.
- **Mapping to Quadrant:**  
  - Choose a source 96-well plate and a destination quadrant for a 384-well plate, then click **Map Wells**.

### Plate Sections
- **96-well Plates:**  
  - Display available plates via checkboxes.  
  - Each plate grid shows well IDs and metadata.
- **384-well Plates:**  
  - Similar layout with additional mapping columns (e.g., source well details).

### Selection Mechanics
- **Simple Click:** Toggle selection of an individual well.
- **Shift+Click:** Select a rectangular group of wells between the last clicked and current well.
- **Header Click:** Toggle selection of an entire row, column, or the full plate.

## Memory Gauge & Data Management
- **The Rat Cache:**  
  - **User Testing Notice:** This gauge is provided while the web app is still in the user testing phase.  
  - It displays the current memory usage of your session.  
  - **Warning:**  
    - At 200MB, a warning is triggered. While modern browsers can handle this load, it‚Äôs up to you to **Purge** the cache if things get too cheesy.  
    - **Purge Action:** Clicking the **Purge ü§Æ** button will clear **all metadata** from the app.  
    - Also, be aware that browser actions such as refresh, back, or forward will erase all metadata.
  
*Don't let your data hoard become a trap‚Äîregular purges keep the system squeaking along nicely, unlike your sorry excuse for lab hygiene.*

## Troubleshooting & Pro Tips

### Common Issues
- **No Wells Selected:**  
  - Ensure you select at least one well before assigning a metadata value.
- **Comma-Separated Assignment Error:**  
  - The number of values in your comma-separated list must match the number of selected wells.
- **Memory Warning:**  
  - If you receive a memory alert, consider purging unnecessary data to prevent browser crashes.

### Pro Tips
- **Efficient Selection:**  
  - Use Shift+Click for quick rectangular selections instead of clicking each well individually.
- **Layer Management:**  
  - Keep your metadata layers succinct. Rename them to reflect their purpose.
- **Exporting Data:**  
  - Verify the visible plates' checkboxes before exporting CSV files to ensure all desired data is included.
- **Undo Usage:**  
  - Use the Undo button immediately after an error‚Äîit‚Äôs your safety net in the maze of data.

## Security & Privacy
- **Local Processing Only:**  
  - RatMap is built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All code runs on your local computer.
- **No Data Transmission:**  
  - Any data you enter is stored in your browser's memory (client-side) and is not submitted or transmitted to any external server.
- **Data Volatility:**  
  - Since your metadata is stored locally, browser actions (such as refresh, back, or forward) will erase all data. Be sure to export your data regularly if needed.
- **User Testing Phase:**  
  - During this phase, your input data remains entirely on your machine, ensuring your experiment details stay private and secure.
